# sandbox-c
Sandbox repo for C++ programs...  will be used for the learning and practice code in C++

This repo contains the solutions I worked for the HackerHank challenges for C++ language. 

The solutions are in individual cpp files. The dificulty level as given by HackerHank is all mixed. The idea of having those exercises is to keep practicing and improving. 

They dont necessarily run per se yet. In future I intend to create unit tests to run it and fitnesse tests to run them with different test cases.
